## What is Bitcoin Confidence Index?
The CBBI is a Bitcoin index that utilizes advanced, real-time analysis of 10 metrics to help us understand what stage of the Bitcoin bull run and bear market cycles we are in. The CBBI is time-independent and price-independent. It simply indicates whether it believes we are approaching the top/bottom of a Bitcoin cycle.

NOTICE: The CBBI is not investment advice. It intends to be a fun way of looking at long-term price movements, disregarding daily noise in volatility. The CBBI is a new index. As such, use it with caution.
